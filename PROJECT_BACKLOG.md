# Project Backlog

## Purpose

`PROJECT_BACKLOG.md` is the single source of truth for open project work. If a
mainline task, sideline, blocker, debt item, or future idea is worth remembering
beyond the current shell session, it must be recorded here before review, ship,
or merge.

`PROJECT_CHAT_AND_WORK_LOG.md` remains the current-state ledger. This file answers
a different question: "What still needs attention, under what conditions, and in
what order?"

GitHub issues are a mirror for worthwhile backlog items, not the authority. Until
sync automation exists, `PROJECT_BACKLOG.md` wins if an issue and the backlog
disagree.

Use `-` when a field is intentionally empty. The `###` heading is the item's
canonical `id`.

## Required Fields

Every backlog item must include these exact fields:

- `title`
- `type`
- `status`
- `phase`
- `priority`
- `owner`
- `depends_on`
- `start_when`
- `done_when`
- `source`
- `link`
- `issue`
- `evidence`
- `last_reviewed_at`
- `opened_at`

Allowed enum values:

- `type`: `mainline`, `sideline`, `blocker`, `debt`, `future`
- `status`: `planned`, `active`, `parked`, `blocked`, `done`
- `phase`: `now`, `next`, `later`
- `priority`: `p0`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`

## Review Rules

- Run a backlog sweep before review, ship, or merge.
- If new work appears during implementation, add it here before asking for review.
- Update `status`, `phase`, and `last_reviewed_at` whenever the item's real state
  changes.
- When an item becomes `done`, replace `evidence: -` with concrete proof.
- For `phase=now` items with `status=planned|active|blocked`, create a mirrored
  GitHub issue and record it in `issue`.
- `deferred:...` is acceptable only for non-`now` items.

- issue: https://github.com/Oscarling/openclaw-team/issues/8
